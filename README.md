Project: Personal Finance Management App
A Personal Finance Management App allows users to manage their income, expenses, savings, and investment goals. This project integrates multiple concepts like data storage, data visualization, and complex algorithms for financial analysis.

Key Features:
Income and Expense Tracker: Users can input their income and expenses and categorize them (e.g., groceries, rent, entertainment).
Budgeting: Allow users to set monthly budgets for different categories and track their spending.
Financial Reports: Generate graphs and pie charts to visualize the user’s spending habits and budget performance.
Savings Goals: Users can set up savings goals and track their progress.
Bill Reminder: Remind users of recurring payments like bills and subscriptions.
Data Encryption: For privacy, store sensitive information securely using encryption techniques.
Implementation Plan:
Database: Use SQLite for local data storage (to store transactions, budgets, and goals).

User Interface:

Use RecyclerView to display transactions and categories.
Use PieChart or BarChart (e.g., from libraries like MPAndroidChart) for visualizing spending.
Set up EditText for adding new income and expenses.
Business Logic: Implement logic to calculate totals, compare against budgets, and generate financial reports.

Data Security: Encrypt sensitive user data using libraries like SQLCipher for database encryption or use Android’s Keystore system to store keys.

Notifications: Use AlarmManager or WorkManager to remind users of upcoming bills or savings goal milestones.Explanation:
The FinanceDBHelper class manages the transactions database (income and expenses).
The MainActivity allows users to input their income and expense, which are added to the database.
You can extend this by adding budget limits, notifications for bills, and financial charts using third-party libraries like MPAndroidChart to show graphs of income vs. expenses.
Extensions & Improvements:
Financial Reports: Use MPAndroidChart to show pie charts or bar charts based on income and expenses.
Recurring Bills Reminder: Use WorkManager or AlarmManager to schedule reminders for recurring bills.
Cloud Sync: Sync the data with a cloud database like Firebase for backup and accessibility across devices.
